LiveSplit.MemoryInfo
=================
Shows a value of a game's memory in LiveSplit. Probably buggy as hell atm.

Manual Installation
-------------------
Download "Components/LiveSplit.MemoryInfo.dll" and place it into the subdirectory "Components" of your LiveSplit folder. You can then add it to your layout (category "Information").

Usage
-----
You need to tell the plugin, where in the memory it can find the value that you want to display. To display the value, use the ID like {1} for example in one of the text boxes. These will be replaced with the actual value in LiveSplit.
